DON WAS TEACHING A CLASS ON THE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN WEST AND PROVIDED THE PRELIMINARY INFORMATION WHICH BILL, A MATH TEACHER, USED TO CONSTRUCT THE OREGON PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED ON THE MINNEAPOLIS SCHOOLS TIMESHARING SYSTEM. ON THE COMPLETION OF THE PRACTICE TEACHING PROGRAM, THE PROGRAM WAS REMOVED FROM THE MINNEAPOLIS SYSTEM AND REMAINED ONLY AS A CURLED UP LISTING UNTIL DON JOINED THE MECC STAFF IN 1974 AND LOADED IT ONTO THE MECC SYSTEM.
